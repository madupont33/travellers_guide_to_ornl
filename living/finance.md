# Social Security Number (SSN)
To get paid in the U.S., you need an SSN. Well actually, it's to pay taxes (the mantra ``to be paid is to pay taxes'').



# Banking
If you're new to the country / area, you might want to find a banking institution. I recommend the ORNL credit union,
because they have a branch inside the ORNL main campus. Note that some large U.S. banks may not
have a branch near you (e.g. the nearest Chase branch is in Kentucky). I still use Chase as my main bank,
and everything is more or less doable online, but if you want that access, make note of that.


# Credit Cards
Sometimes you might want a credit card. If you don't have a credit history (It hasn't been long since you've
been in the U.S.), it might be hard for you to get a credit card. Again, your best
bet would be the ORNL credit union. Also, for people with short credit histories,
Discover is a good option. They are known for giving out credit cards easily. You might have a
lower credit limit (~$500), though. But hey, you gotta start somewhere right?
